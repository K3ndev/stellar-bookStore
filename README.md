# Overview

This project consists of two main services and a mock database setup for development purposes. Here's a brief description of each service:

1. `client`: Handles the client-side user interface with react + vite + sass + radix-ui
2. `server`: Manages Express server and connect to mongoDB
3. `mock-db`: A docker-based mock database (mongoDB) setup for development. 
    - `mongodb://${username}:${password}@${host}:${port}` connect it using mongoDB compass
